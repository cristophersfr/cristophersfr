 
### Hi! I'm Cristopher Freitas! 👋

I'm a software engineer from Brazil! 🇧🇷  
Passionate by coding, science and sports.  
Also my wife (love u sweety!) and my little dog, Frodo 🐶.  
Usually I spend my free time occasionally gaming with friends and family.  

I'm mostly interested in Machine Learning applications concerning Natural Language Processing and Graphs.  
More specifically, I've been targeting the understanding of how individual decision-making affects the collective behavior of our society.  
Although working as a Software Engineer, I come from a very strong academic background.
